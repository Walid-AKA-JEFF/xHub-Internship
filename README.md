# XHUB-LEARNING

This repository contains all the apps and projects I developed during my internship at xHub.

## Contents

### 1. CRUD_post (crud-app)
A simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to:
- **Create** a new post (with title and body)
- **Read** (view) all posts
- **Update** (edit) any post inline
- **Delete** any post

All posts are stored in the browser's localStorage, so your data will persist even after refreshing the page.

### 2. CRUD Spring Boot App
A backend application built with Spring Boot (Java) that provides a RESTful API for managing resources (such as posts or users).  
It supports:
- **Create**: Add new resources via POST requests
- **Read**: Retrieve resources via GET requests
- **Update**: Modify resources via PUT/PATCH requests
- **Delete**: Remove resources via DELETE requests

This app is useful for learning backend development, REST API design, and integration with frontend apps.

### 3. TODO App
A simple task management web app that allows users to:
- **Add** new tasks
- **Mark tasks as completed**
- **Edit** existing tasks
- **Delete** tasks

This app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and stores tasks in localStorage for persistence.
