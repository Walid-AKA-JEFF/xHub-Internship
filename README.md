# XHUB-LEARNING

This repository contains all the apps and projects I developed during my internship at xHub.

## Contents

### 1. CRUD_post (crud-app)
A simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to:
- **Create** a new post (with title and body)
- **Read** (view) all posts
- **Update** (edit) any post inline
- **Delete** any post

All posts are stored in the browser's localStorage, so your data will persist even after refreshing the page.
